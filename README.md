This is a fairly static React app without any moving parts, created with creat-react-app. Not data storage either; state informtaion is saved locally in the client's browser (so saved state disappears when cookies are refreshed). 

Code isn't clean, but I threw this togehter in a couple of hours just because I wanted the tool mostly for myself. I only bought a domain and hosted it because my friends wanted to use it too :)
